Propose the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used as a basis for the development of following systems. Give reasons for your answers.a]Waterfall model should be the appropriate choice here, as the project is complex. The model is the best choice when the requirement and predictability of project's process and completion is already known.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              b]The unavoidable change of information world and higher expectation of library users impel the library ILS vendors to pay attention to what is happening to the industry and the consequence if they fail to keep up with the change. The appearance of some next-generation ILSs reflects the ILS providers’ adaptation to the change.                                                                                                                                                                                      c]Advanced order processing systems can span multiple continents to track and facilitate international orders, shipments and returns for a wide range of product lines and consumer segments.Order processing systems can utilize both the new and old processes, mixing traditional manual methods with technological solutions. A wholesaler, for example, may have salespeople who manually write down order information, then enter the information into a computer software package that automatically forwards the information to the packing and shipping departments.
 Describe the software process model that you have proposed in question 5(a) highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.Some advantages of the waterfall model are as follow. Before the next phase of development, each phase must be completed,Any changes in software is made during the process of the development,Project is completely dependent on project team with minimum client intervention and Elaborate documentation is done at every phase of the software’s development cycle. while the disadvantages is as follows.Small changes or errors that arise in the completed software may cause a lot of problems,Clients valuable feedback cannot be included with ongoing development phase and Documentation occupies a lot of time of developers and testers
